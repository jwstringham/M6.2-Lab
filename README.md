# M6.2 Lab

This project is a simple web-based lab exercise for practicing front-end development concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. 
* This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. 
* There is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. 
* Additionally, you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Usage
* Open the project folder in VSCode.
* Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
* The site will open in your default browser.
